## Overview

PackSplorer is an interactive, user-friendly application designed to aid in travel preparation. This application allows to create a personalized packing checklist for your trips. Items can be added to the list, and as each item is packed, users can mark them off, providing a clear, organized approach to packing. Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, Packsplorer integrates essential features such as conditional rendering, state handling and props passing to provide an efficient, seamless packing experience, ensuring nothing essential is forgotten.

Here's a brief overview of the key components of interest:

- `App`: This is the main component that uses state hooks to maintain and manipulate the list of items. It provides several functions to handle events from the rest of the components, such as adding, deleting, toggling the state of items, as well as clearing and sorting the entire list.

- `Footer`: This component illustrates the concept of conditional rendering. Based on the total number of items and the packed ones, it renders a corresponding message.

- `Form`: This component is a form that allows the user to add new items to the list. Each added item has a description, a quantity, a packed status, along with a unique id generated by the uuid library.

- `PackingList`: This component renders a list of items, which are sourced from the main App component. It uses the map() function to create an Item component for each item in the item collection. The order of the items can be adjusted based on the "sortBy" value.

- `Sort`: This component provides a way to sort the items in the list based on the input order, description, or packed status. It also provides a button to clear the entire list when it contains at least one item.
